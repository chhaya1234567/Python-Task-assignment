    "### Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of objects. Objects are instances of a class, which is a blueprint or template for creating objects. In OOP, we create classes to represent real-world entities, and objects to represent instances of those entities.\n",
    "### A class is a user-defined data type that defines a set of attributes and methods. Attributes are data members that represent the state of the object, and methods are functions that represent the behavior of the object. A class provides a blueprint for creating objects, but it does not actually create any objects itself.\n",
    "### An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It is created by calling the class constructor, which creates a new object with the specified attributes and methods. Objects have their own unique state, which is defined by their attributes, and their own behavior, which is defined by their methods.\n",
